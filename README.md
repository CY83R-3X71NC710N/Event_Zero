## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CY83R-3X71NC710N/Project_Nexus.git
cd Project_Nexus
```

### 2. Set Your API Key
**CRITICAL**: You must export your Gemini API key:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key-here"
```

> üí° **Get your API key**: Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) to obtain your free Gemini API key.

### 3. Run the Analyzer
```bash
python3 autonomous_docker_malware_analyzer.py --file /path/to/malware/sample
```

### Example Usage
```bash
# Analyze the included test sample
python3 autonomous_docker_malware_analyzer.py --file fake_malware

# Analyze with custom API key
python3 autonomous_docker_malware_analyzer.py --file malware.exe --api-key "your-key"
```

- **Deep Code Analysis**: Disassembly, control flow, function mapping
- **Adaptive Tool Selection**: AI chooses optimal tools for each discovery

### Phase 3: Iterative Refinement
- Continues analysis until 100% behavioral understanding
- Self-heals from errors and adapts strategies
- Correlates findings across multiple analysis tools
- Generates comprehensive plain-English reports

### Phase 4: Complete Documentation
- Maps every function and system call
- Explains malware family and techniques
- Documents persistence mechanisms
- Provides threat assessment and mitigation strategies
